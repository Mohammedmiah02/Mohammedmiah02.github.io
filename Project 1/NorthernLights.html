          <p><i>THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or nothern lights, begin hight
          in the Earth's atmosphere--at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles--
          when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's
          magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dacning, lightshow.</p>

      <p><i>THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or northern lights, being high
      in the Earth's atmosphere--at altitudes from 60 to more than 250mph--When
      charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field.
      The result is a colorful, dancing ligtshow.</p>

      <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an Icebreaker in Antartica.
      Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these
      light shows yourself. For the best scenes to this celestial scene, consider
      anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55&#176; and low light pollution.
      Find your magentic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>

      <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter
      nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March
      and September, the Eart's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact
      with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox
      in September, where there are pleasent temperatures in polar latitudes. Find
      the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.</p>
