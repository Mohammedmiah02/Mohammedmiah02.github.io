        <p>The Aurora Boeralis takes its name from the Roman Goddess
        of dawn, Aurora, <br> and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas.
        From September to April, <br> Iceland is a hotspot of this magnificent lightshow.
        The Aurora Borealis, more <br> commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a
        natural phenomenon created <br> when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere <br>
        in the Earths magnetic field. This releases energy, causing particular <br> luminous green streaks
        across the skies.

        <p>When making a trip to Iceland, It is hard not to pay attention to the countrys <br>
        namesake -- namely, its 4500 miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is <br>
        practice year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and <br>
        Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which trips are offered from <br>
        Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).
